Our formula is backed by 30 years of experience with the use of herbs. Each ingredient was selected for its documented medicinal and nutritional values, and has its own unique frequency that has been tested to ensure it resonates with similar frequencies in the body. This allows us to use fewer herbs with better results.\nThere are many natural products on the market that may be effective in the things that Faith has a role in helping with. However, the Faith's Cleanse &amp; Detox formula goes much deeper than selecting a variety of herbs that are known to have certain benefits. Each herb has been tested and selected for its own specific frequency that resonates with similar frequencies related to areas of the body. This allows the use of fewer herbs with better results.\nFaith's Cleanse &amp; Detox is packed under license from Coburg Health by Augustine Approved and distributed worldwide by Augustine Approved. Faith's Cleanse &amp; Detox is the result of over 30 years' experience by a dedicated group of animal lovers (including a bioengineer and naturopath/herbalist) who wanted the best for animals.\n \n ",

Our Super Veggie Mix is based on the raw, ancestral diet and mimics the stomach contents of their ancestral wild prey, only is even better than nature intended!\nIt’s high in protein, antioxidants, omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin C, B1, B6 and A (to name a few), fiber, manganese, potassium, selenium, folate, iron, calcium, phosphorous and more.\nI developed this mix in response to Ruby’s cancer diagnosis and combined it with fresh, raw, human quality meat such as grass fed beef, or kangaroo, or free range and chemical free chicken, or even sardines to create a healthy, balanced meal that fed her but not the cancer. The proportion of Super Veggie Mix to meat should be generally 30-40% to 70-60% (which also includes 10% offal) but this can change depending on your dog’s health needs and if you are looking to generate ketosis.\n ",

Soak feet for a minimum of 5 minutes and a maximum of 15 minutes. Gently scrub the paws with the bath bag.\n \nBATH\nPlace bath bag and cup water into bath (ensuring the water is safe to touch), and soak the dog for a minimum of 5 minutes and a maximum of 15 minutes. *It is important to keep trouble areas submerged for as long as possible for up to 15 minutes. If you are not able to submerge certain areas during a bath, use a large plastic cup to poor the bath water over the dog repeatedly. It is recommended to use the bath bag as a sponge to scrub trouble areas and to continually squeeze and dab the bath bag over sensitive and non-submersible areas. For best results with trouble areas, use as often 1-2 times daily for the first 5 days and then reduce frequency to once every two days, then every 3-4 days and so on. Whilst no other shampoos or conditioners are needed, if you decide to use them we recommend always finishing the bath with Augustine’s SuperBath.\nINGREDIENTS\n1. Licorice Root2. Pau d’Arco3.

      "description": "Premium New Zealand certified Dynacol™ Zeolite• Processed in Australia using the world’s most advanced micronisation &amp; activation process• Food &amp; Dietary mineral supplement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynacol™ Zeolite powder has a role in:\n• Promoting healthy skin, vibrant coat &amp; strong nails• Aiding the immune system to function efficiently• The trapping and removal of heavy metals• Improving the absorption of nutrients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZeolite is a naturally formed mineral, created when volcanic rock and ash meet alkaline water. Zeolite has a unique microporous 'honeycomb' atomic structure with a strong negative charge.During its formation the zeolite traps valuable trace minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium within its framework. The zeolite’s porous ‘honeycomb’ structure, stability and strong negative charge allow it to electro-magnetically trap and hold positively-charged particles, such as heavy metals and other toxins. In order to take on positively-charged ions and toxins, it discharges its beneficial trace minerals through the process that is known as cation exchange.Dynacol™ stands for Dynamic Collision - the world’s most advanced world-wide patented micronisation and activation method used to process zeolite (processed in Australia).Ball-milling and jet-milling are the conventional methods of micronising and activating zeolite, however they produce a far less efficient product. Dynacol™ is also a vast improvement on TMAZ technology and has taken zeolite benefits once again, to the next level.The benefits of Dynacol™ technology include producing zeolite that is more reactive, has an increased surface area, and a more efficient particle shape and size. Taking the best zeolite we could source and processing it using Dynacol™ technology ensures that our customers receive the best zeolite products in the world.Although there is no current option to certify rock minerals as organic, Dynacol™ Zeolite is accepted for input into organic production.\n\n\n\n\n \nFEEDING GUIDE (HALVE FOR PUPPIES &amp; KITTENS)\n\n\n\n\nMiniature / Small Breed Dogs &amp; Cats - 1/4-1/2 tsp.\nMedium / Large Breed - 1/2-3/4 tsp.\nGiant Breed - 1-1.5 tsp. \nWe recommend mixing with Raw Coconut Oil.\n \nALWAYS ADD RAW COCONUT OIL or water and mix well into food using a spoon. Please DO NOT sprinkle on top of food. Dynacol Zeolite can be fed together with Augustine's SuperBoost and Faith's Cleanse &amp; Detox. For fussy eaters, please commence with only Augustine's SuperBoost and Dynacol Zeolite, and then introduce Faith's Cleanse &amp; Detox 2-3 days later. Please also consider the Fussy Eaters Guide on the Faith's Cleanse &amp; Detox label.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients: Premium New Zealand certified Dynacol® zeolite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "WHAT IS IT?\nAugustine’s SuperBoost is the world’s first 100% certified organic supplement made entirely from wholefoods and specially formulated for canines. It is based on the formula found in our flagship fresh food product, Augustine’s SuperFood.\nThis nutritional powerhouse is suitable for ALL dogs and can be added to dry, canned, raw &amp; homemade meals. You can even use the free recipes on the Augustine Approved website to make Augustine’s SuperFood at home!\nAugustine’s SuperBoost contains ingredients used by top performing athletes. It is packed with so much goodness that not only is it safe for human consumption, we actually encourage you to add it to your own food. It is an excellent addition to smoothies.\n \nKEY BENEFITS\n\nMade under &amp; governed by human food standards\nProduced entirely from wholefoods (no synthetics)\nProvides vital nutrients that processing can destroy \nAssists in the maintenance of healthy joints\nPromotes normal, healthy growth and development\nPromotes healthy skin, shiny coat &amp; strong nails\nPromotes digestion and absorption of nutrients\nPromotes healthy organ function\nHelps maintain a healthy gut\n\n \nWHY SHOULD I ADD AUGUSTINE'S SUPERBOOST TO MY DOG'S DIET?\nSimply put, Augustine's SuperBoost is just that - a boost. It helps maintain a higher quality of life. It contains a range of high quality nutrients not found anywhere else.\nNo matter how well you currently feed your dog, Augustine's SuperBoost is a great addition to any canine diet.\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORANGE VEGAN VERSION AND THE RED LABEL?\nSame ingredients. Same goodness. Both are suitable for ALL dogs.\nHowever, the vegan orange label has been specially formulated for dogs living solely on a vegan diet - whether it be short-term or long-term. The balance of each ingredient is different to that of the red label. If you would like optimum benefit for a vegan dog then we suggest you select the Vegan orange label. If there is meat in the diet, feed the original red label. If there is no meat in the diet, feed the orange vegan label. Given that cats primarily consume meat as part of their diet, it is advised to use the Original red label for cats.\n \nDry, canned &amp; raw commercial foods\nThe majority of pet food companies rely on synthetic supplementation to compensate for the natural nutrients destroyed during cooking (irrespective of price or quality of the ingredients). Synthetic supplements are also used to help products meet standards that will allow companies to label their products as balanced. Whilst on paper these products appear to be nutritionally balanced, it is no secret that many synthetic vitamins lack the important nutritional co-factors needed to assist the body in absorbing and assimilating nutrients.\nUnlike synthetic vitamins which contain no trace minerals and must utilise the body's own mineral reserves, wholefood complexes are recognised as real food. The body can digest and assimilate wholefood nutrients without having to rob itself of the trace minerals and other co-factors necessary to complete the vitamins synergistic operation. Research indicates that over time synthetic vitamins may actually cause nutritional deficiencies.\nAugustine’s SuperBoost is made entirely from highly digestible plant ingredients. You could say that it helps put the goodness back that processing takes out.\n \nRaw &amp; homemade meals\nAugustine's SuperBoost is a great addition to homemade meals (including raw). It helps improve stools and aids with digestion by promoting healthy organ function.\nMany dog guardians would love to prepare fresh food for their dogs however they are reluctant to do so because of the fear of producing unbalanced meals. Our recipes have not only been verified by a leading canine nutritionist as balanced, they far exceed AAFCO standards. Why not give our recipes a try?\n \nHOW DO I KNOW IF THE FOOD I AM FEEDING MY DOG HAS SYNTHETIC SUPPLEMENTS?\nIf the ingredients list on the packaging seems as if it is in another language, then have a look for the english version. No, seriously... all those long and strange scientific sounding ingredients are usually synthetic supplements. If the label says the product includes, \"vitamins\" or \"minerals\" then you guessed it... synthetic. Google is your friend!\n \nHOW OFTEN DO I SUPPLEMENT MY DOG’S MEAL?\nASB is recommend for use in every meal, but you can use it as often as you like.\nALWAYS ADD RAW COCONUT OIL or water and mix well into food using a spoon. Please DO NOT sprinkle on top of food. ASB can be fed together with Faith's Cleanse &amp; Detox and Dynacol Zeolite. For fussy eaters, please commence with only Augustine's SuperBoost and Dynacol Zeolite, and then introduce Faith's Cleanse &amp; Detox 2-3 days later. Please also consider the Fussy Eaters Guide on the Faith's Cleanse &amp; Detox label.\n \nFor Optimum Results feed your dog a daily minimum of:\n\nMiniature 1/4 - 1/2 tsp.\nSmall 1/2 - 1 tsp.\nMedium 1 - 2 tsp.\nLarge - 1 - 1.5 tbsp.\nGiant - 1.5 - 2.5 tbsp.\n\nHalve the amount for puppies.\n \nAugustine’s SuperBoost is also healthy for cats:\n\nKitten 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. daily\nAdult 1/2 - 1 tsp. daily\n\n\n \nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORANGE VEGAN VERSION AND THE RED LABEL?\nSame ingredients. Same goodness. Both are suitable for ALL dogs.\nHowever, the vegan orange label has been specially formulated for dogs living solely on a vegan diet. The balance of each ingredient is different to that of the red label. If you would like optimum benefit for a vegan dog then we suggest you select the Vegan orange label.\n \nSO WHAT DOESN'T AUGUSTINE APPROVE?\nAdditives, chemicals, colourings, dairy, fillers, flavourings, grains, gluten, irradiation, meat or meat by-products, MSG, palm oil, preservatives, salts, sweeteners, synthetics, and GMOs.\n \nJust like all our products, Augustine's SuperBoost carries the following symbols:\nVegan",

      "description": "\nThe Big Dog Bed Chinchilla\nBig dogs needn't sacrifice luxury for comfort. Our Chinchilla range brings a touch of luxe to the modern home. Finished in decor two tone furnishing fabric on the base and a super-soft luxurious faux fur charcoal top.\n*Please note: Due to the nature of the two-stage dyeing process, some shade/colour variations and markings may occur. \nWe use a combination of two foams for our Big Dog Bed. Memory foam tops the thick inner of the bed while the bottom is what's termed 'load-bearing' foam. It's there to support the dog's weight &amp; is absolutely necessary for the memory foam to have the desired effect.\nIt really needs to be felt to be believed but the memory foam moulds beautifully to the contours of a dog's body ensuring all over, even support. Its low impact, dampening effect makes it ideal for older dogs, big or heavy dogs &amp; dogs with joint problems. The wrap-around zip makes the fully washable cover so easy to get on &amp; off AND gives you the option to interchange tops between the black, water-resistant, 600 denier, PU coated ripstop &amp; the fluffy natural mock lambswool.\nSIZE XLarge\nAUSTRALIAN MADE",

The curved shape makes the toy easy for dogs to hold in place with paws.\nDog owners will love that Qwizl® is:\n\nTop Rack Dishwasher safe\nLatex-free\nFDA-compliant\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nWe've gotten some questions about how to get any remaining pieces of a treat out of their dog's Qwizl. We suggest one of two methods:\n\nTake a pair of pliers and insert it into toy to grab leftover treat and pull them out.\nSoak Qwizl toy in hot, soapy water to loosen up the treat. When treat has softened up, it should be easy to get out of toy.\n\nPlease remember your dog’s safety is your responsibility. No dog toy is indestructible. Choose only toys that are the appropriate shape and size for your dog and always supervise your dog’s use of toy. If your dog is one of the few that can damage one of our tough Zogoflex toys,",

Moreover, by prolonging feeding times, Slo-Bowls reduce the risks for bloat, regurgitation, and canine obesity. Dogs quickly learn to “chase” their food through the maze of ridges and valleys, making dinnertime feel more like a hunt. And, because the Slo-Bowl “rewards” their play with bits of food, furry friends become more and more engaged as the meal goes on. Veterinarians agree that slower feeding is safer feeding. When it’s time to dine, feed your dog with peace of mind. Promotes natural eating habits Helps prevent bloat, regurgitation, and canine obesity Made with high-quality, food-safe materials Rubber-molded foundation reduces sliding and food spillage Holds up to 2 cups of dry dog food\n",

      "description": "We highly recommend this bowl as its what we use to feed our dogs Maggie &amp; Dougie!\n\nThe Slo-Bowl is a natural, healthy, and playful solution for dogs that gobble their kibble too quickly.\nThese bowls are perfect for raw and fresh food diets as well as kibble.\nOur nature-inspired designs promote natural eating habits by requiring dogs to forage for their feasts. Moreover, by prolonging feeding times, Slo-Bowls reduce the risks for bloat, regurgitation, and canine obesity. Dogs quickly learn to “chase” their food through the maze of ridges and valleys, making dinnertime feel more like a hunt. And, because the Slo-Bowl “rewards” their play with bits of food, furry friends become more and more engaged as the meal goes on. Veterinarians agree that slower feeding is safer feeding. When it’s time to dine, feed your dog with peace of mind. Promotes natural eating habits Helps prevent bloat, regurgitation, and canine obesity Made with high-quality, food-safe materials Rubber-molded foundation reduces sliding and food spillage Holds up to 2 cups of dry dog food\n",

Easy to use and clean, this dog game is sure to be a new favorite! TRAINING WITH TREATS: The Nina Ottosson Dog Smart is an entry level dog game that challenges your dog to discover treats through problem solving and exciting hidden rewards! MIXING IT UP: The bones in this dog puzzle can be arranged to be flush with the board or elevated for different levels of challenges. When the bones (puzzle pieces) on the Dog Smart are flush with the board, your dog will learn to paw and nuzzle at the pieces differently than when the bones are elevated and more easily removeable. HOLDS FOOD: The Dog Smart is great for treating and feeding your dog because it holds wet or dry kibble! LEVEL 1 CHALLENGE: Great for introducing your dog to treat training games, this Level 1 dog game gets your dog interested in games and prepares your pup for more exciting and challenging puzzles to come. HOW TO PLAY: Place treats or kibble in compartments of base. Cover treat compartments with bones. The more compartments that are covered, the harder the game will be. Let the games begin! Show your dog where the treats are and watch them find the tasty reward! Dogs are smarter than you think. Sometimes we just need to teach them! Leave some compartments uncovered for your dog to gain interest. PLAY TOGETHER: Nina Ottosson Dog Puzzle Games focus on challenging your dog’s brain. Supervise when playing, and don´t let the dog chew on the toy. Teach your dog how to use the puzzle, play and have fun together. Put away until next time. EXERCISE FOR MIND AND BODY: Dog games and dog puzzles by Nina Ottosson challenge your dog’s problem solving skills while enhancing your dog’s mental stimulation through fun and play.

      "description": "\nBUILT FOR TOUGH CHEWERS\nThe perfect treat holder for our mackerel twists and bully sticks!\nThis award-winning toy was brilliantly designed to extend the life of expensive dog treats while keeping dogs busy. The side openings release scent and taste while the continuous interior hole allows treats to extend out. Flexible ridges grip multiple sizes of treats. One of our toughest dog toys, Qwizl is also fun to toss, fetch, and chew even after the treats are gone. The curved shape makes the toy easy for dogs to hold in place with paws.\nDog owners will love that Qwizl® is:\n\nTop Rack Dishwasher safe\nLatex-free\nFDA-compliant\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nWe've gotten some questions about how to get any remaining pieces of a treat out of their dog's Qwizl. We suggest one of two methods:\n\nTake a pair of pliers and insert it into toy to grab leftover treat and pull them out.\nSoak Qwizl toy in hot, soapy water to loosen up the treat. When treat has softened up, it should be easy to get out of toy.\n\nPlease remember your dog’s safety is your responsibility. No dog toy is indestructible. Choose only toys that are the appropriate shape and size for your dog and always supervise your dog’s use of toy. If your dog is one of the few that can damage one of our tough Zogoflex toys,",

The side openings release scent and taste while the continuous interior hole allows treats to extend out. Flexible ridges grip multiple sizes of treats. One of our toughest dog toys, Qwizl is also fun to toss, fetch, and chew even after the treats are gone. The curved shape makes the toy easy for dogs to hold in place with paws.\nDog owners will love that Qwizl® is:\n\nTop Rack Dishwasher safe\nLatex-free\nFDA-compliant\nMade in the U.S.A.\n\nWe've gotten some questions about how to get any remaining pieces of a treat out of their dog's Qwizl. We suggest one of two methods:\n\nTake a pair of pliers and insert it into toy to grab leftover treat and pull them out.\nSoak Qwizl toy in hot, soapy water to loosen up the treat. When treat has softened up, it should be easy to get out of toy.\n\nPlease remember your dog’s safety is your responsibility. No dog toy is indestructible. Choose only toys that are the appropriate shape and size for your dog and always supervise your dog’s use of toy. If your dog is one of the few that can damage one of our tough Zogoflex toys,",

      "description": "We highly recommend this bowl as its what we use to feed our dogs Maggie &amp; Dougie!\n\nThe Slo-Bowl is a natural, healthy, and playful solution for dogs that gobble their kibble too quickly.\nThese bowls are perfect for raw and fresh food diets as well as kibble.\nOur nature-inspired designs promote natural eating habits by requiring dogs to forage for their feasts. Moreover, by prolonging feeding times, Slo-Bowls reduce the risks for bloat, regurgitation, and canine obesity. Dogs quickly learn to “chase” their food through the maze of ridges and valleys, making dinnertime feel more like a hunt. And, because the Slo-Bowl “rewards” their play with bits of food, furry friends become more and more engaged as the meal goes on. Veterinarians agree that slower feeding is safer feeding. When it’s time to dine, feed your dog with peace of mind. Promotes natural eating habits Helps prevent bloat, regurgitation, and canine obesity Made with high-quality, food-safe materials Rubber-molded foundation reduces sliding and food spillage Holds up to 2 cups of dry dog food\n",

      "description": "Outward Hound's Granby Splash Dog Life Jacket is a high-performance dog flotation device for boating, water sport adventures and activities with dogs. Designed to keep your dog safe while allowing them to enjoy the water. Top dual grab handles provide an easy method of retrieving your dog if an emergency arises while the front float support and adjustable straps keep them secure both in and out of water. Since dogs come in various sizes and body shapes, please select the appropriate life jacket size after taking the girth measurement or the widest part of your dog's rib cage. Make sure to take any other unique traits (large shoulders, long torso, etc.) into consideration. GIrth Measurement Size Chart: XS: 11-15 in (28-39 cm) Small: 16-20 in (40-51 cm) Medium: 21-27 in (52-69 cm) Large: 28-32 in (70-81 cm) XL: 33-44 in (82-112 cm)\n\nSPLASH WITH SAFETY: The Outward Hound Granby Splash Life Jacket is designed with bright colors and reflective accents to provide better visibility while swimming. A front float support helps keep your dog's head above water whether they're a novice or experienced swimmer.\nNOVICE &amp; EXPERIENCED SWIMMER FRIENDLY: The Granby Splash dog life jacket is constructed with ripstop material that provides maximum buoyancy in the water, and doesn’t restrict movement on land. Adjustable side release buckles provide a secure fit and a neoprene belly band supports their chest and belly.\nRESCUE-HANDLE DESIGN: Grab handles provide easy access to rescue and restraint dog while swimming. Extra-small and small sizes have one handle, while all other sizes contain two handles.\nSIZING BASED ON GIRTH: Dogs come in all shapes and sizes so whether your dog is short and stout or long and lanky, there’s a Granby life jacket fit for them. Available in sizes extra-small to extra-large, we’ve made it easy for you to choose a size that supports them based on their girth measurement.\nPLAY IT SAFE: No pet accessory is indestructible. Do not leave with unsupervised pets. Remove and replace if damaged.\n\nSAFETY AND CARE: This is a floatation aid intended for use on a conscious dog in calm waters. Use rescue handle to lift dogs in emergencies only. Do not leave dog unattended while using this product. Intended for dog use only.\n",

In each flap there is a compartment where the treat can be hidden. Increase the degree of difficulty by locking the flaps using the bone-shaped pegs on top. A tip is to place a treat under a peg. \nTips…Mix some meaty dog food with water, pour some of the mixture in the compartments, put the game in the freezer and let it set. This is perfect for hot days or when the dog needs some extra activity. \nSuits dogs and cats of all ages and sizes.\n ",
